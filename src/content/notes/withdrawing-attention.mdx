title: Withdrawing attention
---

After reading an article by Hugh McGuire, founder of LibriVox, in late 2024, I vowed to reduce my social media usage, [noting](https://social.coop/@codemacabre/113480440297940631) that although I didn't post much, I did find myself doomscrolling far too often, which was affecting my ability to read and reducing my creative output.

McGuire states that "digital devices and software are finely tuned to train us to pay attention to them, no matter what else we should be doing"[^1]. In _The New York Times_, David Brooks identifies a related phenomenon:

> The online world ... nurtures agility, but there is clear evidence by now that it encourages a fast mental rhythm that undermines the ability to explore narrative, and place people, ideas and events in wider contexts.[^2]

On leaving Facebook, [Jenny Odell](https://www.jennyodell.com/) writes:

> Civil disobedience in the attention economy means withdrawing attention. ... A real withdrawal of attention happens first and foremost in the mind. What is needed, then, is not a "once-and-for-all" type of quitting but ongoing training: the ability not just to withdraw attention, but to invest it somewhere else, to enlarge and proliferate it, to improve its acuity.[^3]

This is what I intend to do; to expand my attention and focus by [reading](/reading) more, and scrolling less.
