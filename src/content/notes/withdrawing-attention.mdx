title: Withdrawing attention
---

After reading an article by Hugh McGuire, the founder of LibriVox, in late 2024, I made a vow to reduce my social media usage. I [noted](https://social.coop/@codemacabre/113480440297940631) that although I didn't post much, I did find myself doomscrolling far too often, which was affecting my ability to read and reducing my creative output. There are many other reasons to avoid social media, but this was a tipping point.

McGuire states that "digital devices and software are finely tuned to train us to pay attention to them, no matter what else we should be doing."[^1] Opining in _The New York Times_, David Brooks identifies a related phenomenon:

> The online world ... nurtures agility, but there is clear evidence by now that it encourages a fast mental rhythm that undermines the ability to explore narrative, and place people, ideas and events in wider contexts.[^2]

In her book on the subject, Jenny Odell asserts that leaving a social media platform is not a single act, but a practice:

> Civil disobedience in the attention economy means withdrawing attention. ... A real withdrawal of attention happens first and foremost in the mind. What is needed, then, is not a "once-and-for-all" type of quitting but ongoing training: the ability not just to withdraw attention, but to invest it somewhere else, to enlarge and proliferate it, to improve its acuity.[^3]

However, Erin Kissane points out that "position[ing] the broad landscape of connection as something that 'we' can simply do withoutâ€”and without which we will indeed feel better and be more productive"[^4] is dangerous. Kissane continues by mentioning Rebecca Solnit's writing on care during and after disaster:

> The need for broad connection becomes literally vital: people live or die based on the resources and help they receive or don't receive.[^5]

Odell also discusses Solnit; indeed, the entire chapter titled 'The Ecology of Strangers' stresses the importance of other people:

> If critical distance is what we're after, I think there's an important distinction to make between isolating oneself versus removing oneself from the clamor and undue influence of public opinion.[^6]

It's a difficult thing to balance, particularly as some of these major platforms become more and more toxic, but there is still value in remaining on select social media (with the exception of Facebook and Twitter). What I intend to do is to expand my attention and focus by [reading](/reading) more, and perhaps scrolling a little less.
