title: The Code Macabre
---

This website, and my online handle, is loosely something of a modern-day allegory based on the medieval [_Danse Macabre_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danse_Macabre). Our decaying forms prod at screens, clinging to our digital selves as death beckons us to the [grave](/notes/on-graveyards).

The meaning of this _Code Macabre_ is that we are all shambling towards our inexorable death, as in the _Danse Macabre_, and are all bound as equals by our shared mortality. We are death, pending.

However, with the advent of digital media, our online detritus lingers, consumed by behemothic digital corporations.

As the fruits of our intelligence are devalued and reassigned to complex probability machines, so too do we deteriorate into hollow shells of our rich existences; our social networks prioritise quantity of interactions over quality and reduce us to more mere data points. We are forever to be leeched of our privacy and individuality until our data merges with the colossal stream that is the web.

Without concerted effort to resist, we will be washed away with the tide of digital ephemera.
