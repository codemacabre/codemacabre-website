title: On graveyards
---

I love taking walks through graveyards, crypts, and catacombs, a fact I include in my [about](/about) page. The reasons for this are partially my interest in death culture and my fondness for nature, but there is something else which is articulated in [Jenny Odell](https://www.jennyodell.com/)'s book _How To Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy_: when I take these walks, I'm doing nothing.

The winding paths between gravestones are labyrinthine, "designed for nothing other than contemplative walking &hellip; enabling a sort of dense infolding of attention." Time appears to pause during these peaceful perambulations; "these places and moments are retreats &hellip; they affect the way we see everyday life when we do come back to it."

And when I do, I return deeply appreciating more, and feeling more real.
