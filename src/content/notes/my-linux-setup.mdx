I'm a big fan of Linux, and I'm especially fond of having a minimal system with no bloatware. I've distro-hopped a number of times trying to find the perfect distro for me, alternating between Debian and Arch a few times. I finally tried [Debian Testing](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting), and having a rolling release version of Debian is exactly what I was looking for.

To install a minimal Xfce desktop environment, I use a similar process to [Craig Coonrad's guide](https://github.com/coonrad/Debian-Xfce4-Minimal-Install), where I install Debian 12 (bookworm), then update sources to use Debian Testing (trixie).

## 1. Install minimal Debian Testing

When installing Debian via the [ISO](https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/debian-installer/), we will encounter a screen titled 'Software selection'. Here, we can select which desktop environment we prefer; I want Xfce, but the checkbox here will install a lot of additional software I don't want, so we should uncheck everything except 'standard system utilities'.

Once installation has finished, we will reboot into a shell environment.

Log in as a root user, then edit the `sources.list` file with,

```sh
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Now, update the file to include the following sources:

```
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian testing main contrib non-free-firmware non-free
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security testing-security main contrib non-free-firmware non-free
```

Save and exit, then update the system with,

```sh
sudo apt update && apt upgrade
```

Then reboot.

## 2. Install minimal Xfce

Rather than installing the standard `xfce` package, which installs a lot of additional utilities, we can install only the essential packages with:

```sh
sudo apt install libxfce4ui-utils thunar xfce4-appfinder xfce4-panel xfce4-session xfce4-settings xfce4-terminal xfconf xfdesktop4 xfwm4
```

Reboot, and we will be greeted with a LightDM login screen which will open up a working minimal Xfce desktop environment.

## 3. Connecting to the internet

There may still be a few essential utilities required to make things run smoothly, such as the Network Manager. Install with,

```sh
sudo apt install network-manager-gnome
```

This will require configuring. Edit the `NetworkManager.conf` file with,

```sh
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
```

In this file, under the `[ifupdown]` section, amend the line from `managed=false` to `managed=true`. Save and exit this file and then restart the Network Manager with,

```sh
sudo service network-manager restart
```

## 4. Theming and adding custom CSS

I like to tweak Xfce to have a nice, clean, single panel.

<Image src={DesktopImg} alt="A minimal Xfce desktop environment with a narrow, dark grey panel along the bottom. The background wallpaper features a still from the animated science fiction series 'Scavengers Reign'." class="greyscale" />

This can be achieved by modifying the panel properies and moving the items around. I use the [Matcha GTK Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Matcha-gtk-theme) to theme the desktop and [Flat Remix](https://github.com/daniruiz/Flat-Remix) for my icons.

We can add a small amount of CSS to adjust the panel spacing. Create a file called `gtk.css` in the `~/.config/gtk-3.0/` directory, and add the following CSS:

```css
.tasklist button, #clock-button, #whiskermenu-button, #xfce4-notification-plugin, #xfce4-power-manager-plugin, #pulseaudio-button {
	border-radius: 0;
}

#whiskermenu-button {
  padding: 0 5px;
}

#xfce4-power-manager-plugin image {
  color: #ffffff;
  opacity: 1;
}

#pulseaudio-button image {
	-gtk-icon-transform: scale(0.9);
  color: #ffffff;
  opacity: 1;
}

#pulseaudio-button .recording-indicator {
  -gtk-icon-transform: scale(0.6);
  padding: 0 5px 0 0;
}

#xfce-panel-toggle-button {
  border-radius: 0;
  padding: 0 5px;
}
```
 
This removes rounded edges from buttons, scales some of the panel icons to make them feel more consistent, makes the semi-transparent icons opaque, and adds some spacing to make the buttons flow better next to each other.

To see these changes, we can restart the panel with the command,

```sh
xfce4-panel -r
```

## 5. Additional applications

These are some of the applications I always install.

- I like to use [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/installation/debian/) for my main browser
- I use [Polypane](https://polypane.app/download/) as an additional development browser
- For my code editor, I use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/#install-on-debian-ubuntu-deb-package)
- I'm fond of the default Xfce Terminal, but I use [ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH#install-and-set-up-zsh-as-default) and [Oh My ZSH!](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-installation) with the [Spaceship prompt](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation) and the [`zsh-autosuggestions`](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md) and [`zsh-syntax-highlighting`](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md) add-ons
- I prefer to download MP3s locally and use the terminal music player, [`kew`](https://github.com/ravachol/kew?tab=readme-ov-file#installing)
- I use IRC, and my favourite client is [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/download/debian/)
