Reading [Jenny Odell's](https://www.jennyodell.com/) book _How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy_ has been enlightening, particularly now, as major social media platforms are becoming more and more toxic.

On leaving Facebook, she writes:

> Civil disobedience in the attention economy means withdrawing attention. ... A real withdrawal of attention happens first and foremost in the mind. What is needed, then, is not a "once-and-for-all" type of quitting but ongoing training: the ability not just to withdraw attention, but to invest it somewhere else, to enlarge and proliferate it, to improve its acuity.[^1]

She continues by suggesting we turn this attention upon ourselves:

> We need ... to understand the algorithmic versions of ourselves that such forces have learned to manipulate, and to know when we are being guilted, threatened, and gaslighted into reactions that come not from will and reflection but from fear and anxiety.[^2]
