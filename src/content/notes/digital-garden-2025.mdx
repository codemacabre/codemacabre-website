import Tag from '../../components/Tag.astro';

While not a fully-functional digital garden (yet), this site has had a few changes which lean in the digital garden direction. All [notes](/notes) have been categorised based on their length and how well-formed the thoughts behind them are.

A <Tag text="musing" /> is a brief thought, largely unformed and needing refinement. A <Tag text="scrawl" /> is a slightly better-formed thought that is vaguely researched, but still incomplete and subject to change. An <Tag text="article" /> is a complete thought, usually longer-form, researched, and less subject to change.

These categories are inspired by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)'s 'Seedling', 'Budding', and 'Evergreen' notes, and [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://www.mentalnodes.com/a-gardening-guide-for-your-mind)'s 'Seeds', 'Trees', and 'Fruits'. 

Currently everything else will be hand-crafted, such as backlinks, and this will most certainly be a work-in-progress (even beyond this site's eternal work-in-progress status).

Expect more regular notes, perhaps a little less well-formed than full-fledged articles.
