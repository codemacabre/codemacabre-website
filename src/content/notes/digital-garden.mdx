This site has had a few changes which lean in the digital garden direction. [Backlinks](/notes/backlinks-in-astro) are now added to the bottom of referenced notes, and all notes are now categorised based on their length and how well-formed the thoughts behind them are.

- A seed is a brief, nascent thought, largely unformed and needing refinement.
- A sprout is a developing thought, often moderately researched but still somewhat incomplete.
- An evergreen note is a more complete thought, usually longer-form, researched, and less subject to change.

These categories are inspired by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)'s 'seedling', 'budding', and 'evergreen' notes, and [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://www.mentalnodes.com/a-gardening-guide-for-your-mind)'s 'seeds', 'trees', and 'fruits'.

Expect more regular notes, perhaps a little less well-formed than polished articles.
