import Tag from '~/components/Tag.astro';

This site has had a few changes which lean in the digital garden direction. Backlinks are now added to the bottom of referenced notes, and all [notes](/notes) are now categorised based on their length and how well-formed the thoughts behind them are.

A <Tag text="seed" /> is a brief, nascent thought, largely unformed and needing refinement. A <Tag text="sprout" /> is a developing thought, often moderately researched but still somewhat incomplete. An <Tag text="evergreen" /> note is a more complete thought, usually longer-form, researched, and less subject to change.

These categories are inspired by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)'s 'Seedling', 'Budding', and 'Evergreen' notes, and [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://www.mentalnodes.com/a-gardening-guide-for-your-mind)'s 'Seeds', 'Trees', and 'Fruits'.

Expect more regular notes, perhaps a little less well-formed than polished articles.
