title: Who Is At Mars Today?
---

Who Is At Mars Today? is a website inspired by [How Many People Are In Space Right Now?](https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/), listing the robots currently operational on the surface of, and on orbit around, Mars.

A future enhancement will be to automatically update Who Is At Mars Today? daily via crowdsourced data. This data will likely be scraped from Wikipedia's [List of Missions to Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_Mars), and parsed using [wtf_wikipedia](https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia).
