BumbleBot was a Twitter bot created using [Processing](http://processing.org/) to post procedurally generated bumblebees.

Originally written as a standalone Processing sketch to explore insect anatomy, it continued to generate accurate bee structures (its bumblebees have slight anatomical variations based on gender; see the antennae, hind legs and abdomen segments for example).

Although not affiliated with any organisation, BumbleBot was inspired by the work of the [Bumblebee Conservation Trust](http://bumblebeeconservation.org/), [IBRA](http://www.ibrabee.org.uk/) and Buglife's [Urban Buzz](https://www.buglife.org.uk/our-work/pollinator-projects/urban-buzz/) project, as well as [@mothgenerator](https://twitter.com/mothgenerator) by Everest Pipkin and Loren Schmidt.
