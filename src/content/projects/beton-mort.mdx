Béton Mort is a series of stylised data visualisations built using [D3](https://d3js.org).

The name is based on the French term, _béton brut_, or 'raw concrete', an architectural concrete associated with brutalism. _Béton mort_, loosely translated as 'concrete death', suggests a brutalist depiction of death, stark and unflinching. 

This project is currently in the very early planning stage.
