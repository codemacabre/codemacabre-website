title: Béton Mort

Béton Mort will be a series of stylised data visualisations built using [D3](https://d3js.org).

The title is based on the French term, _béton brut_, or 'raw concrete', an architectural concrete associated with brutalism. _Béton mort_, then, evokes a brutalist depiction of mortality, stark and unflinching.

The project will explore death and decay through the textures and structures generated by mortality data.
