 A fun side interest of playing videogames led me to start a group for exploring maps and navigation in videogames. Cartogaming is a list of games with interesting or unusual cartography, navigation and exploration mechanics.

 Although I have limited time to play these days, I'm always looking for new games to add to the list.
