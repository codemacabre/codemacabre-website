ObitBot was a Twitter bot created using [Processing]((http://processing.org/)) to post procedurally generated obituaries.

> Here lies someone who died of a malignant neoplasm of the trachea. Farewell.

The obituaries ObitBot tweeted were based on real mortality data, highlighting the rates of death by cause worldwide. ObitBot provided a constant fictional feed designed to mirror our own species' deaths, albeit at a greatly decreased rate to comply with Twitter API limits.

These fictional obituaries were assigned a procedurally generated tombstone, making ObitBot a virtual cemetery and a place to confront, and reflect upon, our inevitable demise.

ObitBot's obituaries were procedurally generated using probabilities calculated from the [WHO Mortality Database](http://www.who.int/healthinfo/mortality_data/). Data was retrieved from all reporting countries using the latest available year (as of November 2016).

While no longer a Twitter bot, ObitBot is in the very early stages of being rejeuvenated. Watch this space.
